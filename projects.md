My work can be categorised in two domains.  
Besides below list, I have applied Machine Learning to many real world problems. 

<h5><b>tl;dr:</b></h5>
I am really good at Machine Learning, Computer Vision and Computer Graphics.  
I possess excellent algirithmic knowledge as well as application layer understanding.
